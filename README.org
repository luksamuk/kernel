* Introduction

This is a toy bare bones kernel written in pure C. Works on x86
platforms.

This project was inspired on the following articles:

- [[https://arjunsreedharan.org/post/82710718100/kernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel][Kernel 101 – Let’s write a Kernel]]
- [[https://arjunsreedharan.org/post/99370248137/kernel-201-lets-write-a-kernel-with-keyboard][Kernel 201 – Let’s write a Kernel with keyboard and screen support]]

...plus a few things from [[https://wiki.osdev.org/][OSDev Wiki]].

* Building

You will need:

- ~nasm~
- ~gcc~
- ~ld~

Just type ~make~ and see the magic happen.

* Running

The ~kernel.bin~ binary runs fine under ~qemu~. Use the ~run.sh~ script to
try it out.
